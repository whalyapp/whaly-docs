## Public Report Management

You can view all publicly shared dashboards and questions at a glance and understand if there are any data leakage to cut it directly at the source.

In order to access the **public report** management go to **Settings** then **Shared Reports.** From there you can access all publicly shared reports and quickly delete them or un-share them. This tool is useful to govern what data goes out of your organization and quickly shut it down if it is not supposed to be shared.

## Exploration Management

You can access all unused exploration in order to clean your workspace and provide a better experience to your end users. We defined a used exploration as an exploration that is at least used once in a non deleted report (dashboard or question).

In order to access all unused exploration, please go to **Settings** then **Unused Explorations** tab. From there you can select all exploration that are not used anymore and delete them safely.
