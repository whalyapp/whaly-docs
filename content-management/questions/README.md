## What is a question ?

A question is a page containing a single chart.

Questions share some features with dashboards, such as :&#x20;

* [Add a description](../dashboards/add-a-description.md)
* [Share a report by link](../../workspace/sharing-and-collaboration/share-a-report-by-link.md)
* [Delete a report](../dashboards/delete-a-report.md)

A question gives you access to three tabs

### Visualisation

The visualisation lets you see the chart associated to your question.&#x20;
