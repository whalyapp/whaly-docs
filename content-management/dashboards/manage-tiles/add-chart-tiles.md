# Add chart tiles

There are two ways to add a chart to a dashboard:

* From an existing chart if you want to copy a chart
* From an exploration if you want to add a new chart

## From an existing chart

If you want to add an existing chart to a dashboard, browse to the chart you want to add, then click on the â‹® -> explore from here. In the drawer that opens, click on the button "Add to report", then select the report you want to add the chart to:&#x20;

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/add chart from existing.gif>)

## From an exploration

On an exploration page, create a chart, then click on the "Save" button, then "Add to report":&#x20;

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (167).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
When editing a report, you can also quickly open an exploration by clicking on the visualisation button in the report action bar
{% endhint %}
