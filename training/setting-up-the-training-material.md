## High level plan

1. Connecting our "Jaffle Shop" source
2. Creating our base exploration
3. Creating our base report
4. Adding our first chart

### 1. Connecting our Jaffle Shop source

The first thing we will need to do is connect our training source. In order to do so, simply head to the source catalog and click on the `Jaffle Shop (Training material)` source. Then, click on the `Connect` button.&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/connect jaffle shop source.gif>)

The Jaffle Shop source is composed of three data tables:

* Customers
* Orders
* Payments

A customer have between 0 and n orders. An order have a customer, and between 1 and n payments. A payment is linked to an order.&#x20;

### 3. Creating our base report

In order to create our training report :&#x20;

1. Head to your workspace. Click on "Create a new report", give it a name (Training for example) and click on "Continue"
2. Click on text
3. Add the following text in the tile :&#x20;

> 3. \[New Chart + New Column + New Drill] Add the Customer name in the Order drill down
> 4. \[New Chart + New Exploration] Add the number of customers per number of orders

### 4. Adding our first chart

The first chart we will add is the number of order per week. To do so:&#x20;

1. On the report, click on Edit
2. Click on **Visualization**
3. Select the "Order" exploration from the list&#x20;
4. Then, reproduce the following query :&#x20;
   1. Click on **Timeseries**
   2. Measure: number of order
   3. Time: order date
   4. Select dates between 2018/01/01 and 2018/04/01
   5. Click on Run query, and display as a bar chart :&#x20;

Our dashboard should look like this now :&#x20;

That's it, we are now ready to work on the training exercices. Head on the the next step in order to deep dive on charts creation :diving\_mask:
