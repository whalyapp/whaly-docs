# Understanding Datasets

## What is a dataset?

A dataset on Whaly represents any kind of data that is outputted by your warehouse and made available through the Whaly interface. Models are datasets, raw data imported from your warehouse or from a third party are also datasets. When a dataset is generated by a SQL or Flow query we call that a Model.

All datasets share common informations such as:

* A name and a description
* Primary keys
* Relationships to other datasets
* Drills definition

Models have specific capabilities such as:

* Materialization

In this section you'll learn how to configure a dataset.&#x20;

If you are looking to model data jump to

{% content-ref url="../model-data/" %}
[model-data](../model-data/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

If you are looking to import datasets either from Third Parties or from your own warehouse jump to

{% content-ref url="../import-raw-data/" %}
[import-raw-data](../import-raw-data/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
