# Drills

Drills are a way of configuring what should be displayed to the end users when they interact with reports by clicking on charts.

It's a great way to:

* Allow your viewers to go beyond just a report aggregated data&#x20;
* Add more interactivity to the report

## Why using drills?

When viewers will start consuming your reports, they will have additional questions.&#x20;

> Why are my sales going up or down?&#x20;
>
> What are the deals currently in closed won or lost? etc.&#x20;

To give more flexibility and level of interaction to viewers, you can set up drills in the [Workbench](../) that will then be automatically available to all your charts in the reporting section.

## How can I configure drills?

In the workbench, at the bottom left corner of your window, click on the "**Drills**" button

From here you can pick any property you want to be available as a Drill and reorder them the way you want by dragging and dropping them.
