To create a Flow, go to D**ata** in the **View Selector** and click on the **+ button** next to **Models.** This should open a panel asking which kind of model you want to create, then click on **Flow.**

You can also click on **New** > **Model** > **Flow.**

You can then give your flow a name, and select if you want to start from scratch or from an existing  dataset.

If you choose to start from an existing dataset the flow created will contain the[ primary keys ](../../understanding-datasets/primary-keys.md)and the [relationships](../../understanding-datasets/relationships.md) of the base dataset.
