# Model Data

## What is a Model ?

A model is a [dataset](../understanding-datasets/) that has been generated by a user. It can either be a SQL Model or a Flow Model depending on your capabilities to write SQL queries.

In order to better understand the differences between the two types of models, please refer to:

{% content-ref url="sql-models.md" %}
[sql-models.md](sql-models.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="flow-models/" %}
[flow-models](flow-models/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Please note that a model can reference another model, therefore you can build foundational models that&#x20;
