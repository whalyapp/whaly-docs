#### IF(condition; expression\_if\_true; expression\_if\_false)

Takes three arguments, the first one must be a boolean and the second and third must return the same type.

In the `expression_if_true` and `expression_if_false` part, you can use **comparators** and **mathematical operations** such as: `+` ,`-` ,`/` ,`*` ,`>` ,`<` ,`=` ,`>=` ,`<=` ,`like`

Examples:

```
IF(column_a > column_b; "column_a is bigger than column_b"; "column_b is bigger than column_a")
IF(column_a + column_b <= 10; "Bigger than 10"; "less than 10")
IF(column_a like "%toto%"; "Toto detected"; "Toto is not here")
```

**Like operator**

The like operator is used to compare strings together and can be used to do "begins with", "ends with", "contains".

Begins with "toto": `column_a like "toto%"`

Ends with "toto": `column_a like "%toto"`

Contains "toto": `column_a like "%toto%"`
