# Import raw data

There are two ways of importing raw data in Whaly. The first one is to use our [Sources](broken-reference), this will allow you to replicate raw data in near real time into your warehouse and so you create model and / or explorations on top of it. The second one is to import directly tables that are already stored into your warehouse into Whaly.
