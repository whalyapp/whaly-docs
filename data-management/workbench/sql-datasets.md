# ðŸ§™â™€ SQL Datasets

SQL datasets are a way of creating datasets in your warehouse from a SQL query that you define on the Whaly interface.

It's a great way to:

* Go beyond Whaly predefined [formulas](formulas.md) and [filters](./#filter-out-the-rows-that-shouldnt-be-visible-in-your-reports) ðŸ’»
* Use a language you are already familiar with

## Why using SQL Datasets

When you want to create complex datasets that require you to join or union several existing datasets together, or require you to use complex transformations before allowing your users to interact with it, you can use a SQL Dataset.

## Creating a SQL Datasets

On the workbench on the "Dataset panel" on your left, open any source and click on "Add Dataset"

![Click on Add Dataset](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (188).png>)

Then enter your future dataset name

![Think carefully about your dataset name](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (173) (1).png>)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Once created you cannot change a dataset name
{% endhint %}

Once your dataset is created, click on its name and then click on the configuration panel

![From here you can edit your SQL query](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (200).png>)

Type the SQL query you want to use in the "SQL Query" text input. Run the query to test that it is properly working and then save it to update your dataset.

{% hint style="info" %}
All SQL datasets are saved as a view in your warehouse, whenever the sql query is updated, your view is updated. We are currently working on the capability to materialize your view in your warehouse.
{% endhint %}

## Writing SQL

Whaly supports your warehouse SQL, so no need of learning another SQL flavor. But because we are running on top of your warehouse with our [access control layer](../../organization/manage-access-control.md),  we require you to use shorthands to reference tables.&#x20;

So, when you used to do:

```sql
SELECT * FROM schema.table
```

You need to transition to:

```sql
SELECT * FROM ${TABLES["Source Name"]["Dataset Name"]} WHERE col_1 > 0
```

Replace your Source Name and Dataset Name by what you see in the dataset panel

For instance, if you want to query the Day dataset in the Days source as seen here

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (212).png>)

You can write the following query

```sql
SELECT ... FROM ${TABLES["Days"]["Day"]} WHERE ...
```
