## Create an exploration from a template

Creating an exploration from a template is the easiest way to get started, as it will allow you to get an exploration with already defined measures, dimensions and related datasets.

To create an exploration from a template, go to the template catalog, select the template you want to use and then click on "Use this template". You will be redirected to the newly created exploration.

## Create an exploration from scratch

Creating an exploration from scratch is useful if you want to explore some specific data or if you can't find a related template for your data.&#x20;

When creating an exploration from scratch, you will be asked to select the dataset you want to start your exploration from. You will be able to leverage the relationships declared in your workbench to add related data inside your exploration.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
It's considered a good practice to start your exploration from the data you want to explore. For instance, if you want to count the number of contacts by their company geographic distribution, you would need to create an exploration based on contacts and add the companies afterwards as a related data.
