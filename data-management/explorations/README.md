# ðŸ§­ Explorations

## What are explorations?

Exploration are a combinations of datasets, relationships and aggregations put together so that your data consumer can safely combine data and create reports without relying on technical expertise.

This help you:

* Boost data adoption by providing a product to your end users
* Make your user more data savvy by giving them tools they understand
* Maintain your company metric layer by controlling how data is being queried
* Reduce maintenance when definition change - when updating a metric or a dimension all reports are subsequently updated with your changes.

An exploration is the entry point to create charts in Whaly.
