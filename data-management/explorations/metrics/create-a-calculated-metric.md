# Create a Calculated Metric

A calculated metric is a metric that is based on other metrics, numbers and operators. When creating a calculated metric, you are presented with a formula editor. For example, let's say that we want to create a metric which is the percentage of gift card payment on a website. We already have two metrics : the total payment on our website and the payments with gift card on our website. Then, our calculated metric would look like the following :&#x20;

### Format your metric

The next step will ask you to select a format for your metric. You can set a custom prefix or suffit (useful for currency, weight, ...), or you can take things a step further by [using the custom format](../add-metrics/using-custom-format.md) feature.

### Add drill down

You can also add a way for your user to explore further than the chart by adding drill down on your metric, please check the following section:
