# Tables

Tables are what hold your measures ([dimension](../add-dimensions.md) & [metrics](../add-metrics/)). They are based on a dataset that you have either [imported](../../workbench/import-raw-data/) or that you have [modeled](../../workbench/). They allow you to use the relationships that you have defined with all your models to add [related data](add-related-data.md) and create exploration that abstract the complexity of joins for your end users. An exploration must have at least one exploration.
