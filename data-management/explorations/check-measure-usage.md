# Check measure usage

When hovering on any dimension or metric, you can check if it is already used in any reports or question.&#x20;

When a metric or a dimension is already in use we will display an arrow next to its name and an alert explaining where it is used. You can still delete it but you should be aware that this cannot be undone and that it might break the reports that are using this measure.
