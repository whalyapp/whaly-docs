# Exploration Templates

Exploration templates are design to help you kickstart an exploration. It is based on raw data coming from Whaly's [sources](../../sources/how-sources-work.md) and will generate an exploration containing dimensions, metrics and related data, for you to get a quick view on how to use your raw data.



You can find all available exploration templates in the [Catalog](../../workspace/catalog.md).
