Whenever you want to combine data from different datasets you can use related data. In order to do so, click on the "+" button and click on "add related data".

Once you have done that, you should see a menu presenting you with all the dataset related to the one you have selected. We based related data on the relationships that have been created in the workbench between your datasets.

Let say that we want to count the number of contact working at a company in a specific domain. Then we want to add Companies as related data to Contact. When doing so we can see that a new table has been added to our exploration and that now I can add dimensions and metrics on companies.

When I count contacts by company domains this will only show me the domain associated to the selected contacts.
