# Metrics

## What is a metric ?

A metric allows you to calculate things over your data.

For example, imagine that you go grocery shopping. If you count the number of tomatoes available in the store, then the "Number of tomato" is a metric. You could also calculate the average number of products in the shelves, which is also a metric.
