This is the documentation about the integration of Whaly Reports and Questions into Hubspot reports.

If you're looking for the Hubspot data connector documentation, [this is where you can find it.](../../sources/source-catalog/sales/hubspot.md)
{% endhint %}

Hubspot is a CRM system that allows your Sales and your Marketing teams to generate leads, nurture them and track their lifecycle in the sales journey ✨

It is the main tool of your Sales team, so in order to provide them with data, it is best to embed directly any Whaly insights into their main tool 🤗

As Whaly is having an holistic view of your data (Database, Support, Finance, Marketing, ...) it is a good way to bring data that is not present into Hubspot to your Sales team so that they can make better decision 🎉

## Embed a Whaly question in a Hubspot report

1. On Whaly 🐳, generate a sharing link for the report you wish to embed. [You can learn more here.](../../content-management/dashboards/share-a-report-by-link.md)
2. On Hubspot, open the report in which you wish to embed your report and click on "Actions 🔽" button at the top right of the screen.
