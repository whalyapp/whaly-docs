# Clickup

[Clickup](https://clickup.com/) is a great place to organise your workplace knowledge in a single place. It's perfect to document and explain internal processes as well as tracking common objectives, such as [OKRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR).

By integrating with Clickup, Whaly is giving you the ability to embed reports directly within your Clickup pages so that you can track your KPIs directly within your everyday tool without having to log to Whaly each time.



## Embed a Whaly report/question in a Notion page

1. On Whaly üê≥, generate a sharing link for the report you wish to embed. [You can learn more here.](../../reporting/dashboards/share-a-report-by-link.md)
2. On Clickup, open the page in which you wish to embed your report and type `/` to list the blocks that you can integrate within Notion. Select the "**Embed**" block type.
3. In the link input, paste the public sharing link of your report. And click on the "SAVE" button to validate.
