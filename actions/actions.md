# âš¡ Actions

Actions are a way to transfer data from Whaly to the outside world.&#x20;

They could either:

* send data to a third party software (Airtable, Google Sheets)
* update records into your CRM
* used to trigger a Webhook (Zapier, Make, n8n)&#x20;
* send reports through a communication channel (Email, Slack, Discord, Teams)

Discover our action catalog to understand what you can do with them. And reach out if you want an Action that is not already in the catalog!
