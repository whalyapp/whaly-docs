# How to explore data

## Explore from your workspace

From your workspace tab, you can access all exploration your builders have created for you. In order to access all explorations from your workspace, click on **Explore** at the top of the [Content Selector](broken-reference). Please note that only [editor](../../organization/manage-access-control.md#editor) and [higher roles](../../organization/manage-access-control.md#builder) have access to explorations.

## Exploring from Report

From a question or a dashboard you can **hover the tile** to click on the **three dots** and click on the **Explore from here** menu. This will open the query in exploration mode allowing you to dig deeper into your analysis. Please note that when you are exploring data you are NOT modifying the query of the chart making it safe for your user to explore without breaking anything.
