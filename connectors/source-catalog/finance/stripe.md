## Metadata support

Many Stripe objects support metadata, which contains custom fields in which you can write custom values (User Id, etc.) to help reconcile the data with your database and other referentials.

Whaly automatically detect all the metadata fields and create a new column for each in the destination table. Those columns names are prefixed with `metadata_`.
