## How do I contact the support team?

Whaly offers 3 main support channels:

a. **Chat**: There is an embedded Chat in Whaly interface that can be used for any request

b. **Support email**: You can email **support\[at]whaly.io**

c. **Slack**: Depending on the support level defined in your plan, you can still use the the private Slack channel during the Onboarding period.

## What information should I share?

To help _us_ help _you_ as efficiently as possible, please be sure to send us all relevant details:

* If your support request relates to a specific page, please make sure to include a link to it.
* Please describe the steps that you are taking, what happens when you take those steps, and what you expected to happen instead.
* If you are running into an error message, please pass along the error message in full.
* Can you send us a screenshot to show us what you're seeing? Or, can you send us a short video to show us the steps that you are taking? These are extremely helpful!

## When will I get a response?

We aim to respond to every message within 1 business day. At busy times this might not be possible, but we'll always get back to you as soon as we are able!
