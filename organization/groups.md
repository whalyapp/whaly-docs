# ðŸ‘­ Groups

Groups are a set of Users that share the same access over a set of dashboards & questions. Properly defining and creating Groups to match your internal organisational structure is key to build a manageable Access Control setup and make sure that everyone has access only to the proper ressources.

### Default groups

By default, 2 groups are created and automatically managed by Whaly:

* **All Users**: This group contains all the users having an access on your Organisation. This group is really handful to give access to "Company wide" dashboards and questions.
* **Admins**: This group contains only the users having an admin access on your Organisation. This group will have access by default to all the content created on your Organisation so that they can administrate it properly.

### Listing all existing groups

In order to list all the existing groups in your Organisation, please go in "**Settings > Groups**" page. There, you'll see the list of existing groups.
