When inviting a user you are asked to select a user role for your invited user. In order to understand what each role can do on the platform and how they are correlated to licensing you can check those articles.

{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="manage-access-control.md" %}

Once this is done you'll see the invite appear in the access view.&#x20;
