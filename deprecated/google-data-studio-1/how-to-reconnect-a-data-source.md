# How to reconnect a data source?

When you wish to change some Data source configuration (Exploration, Date to filter on), you need to reconnect your Data source.

To update your fields in Google Data Studio, (you need to be in [Edit mode](https://docs.whaly.io/visualize/google-data-studio-1/google-data-studio-interface-explained)) start by editing the data source.&#x20;

You can do that by clicking on a chart and click on the edit button

The following panel will open

You then need to click on "**EDIT CONNECTION**" on the top left side of the panel.

You can now update the configuration that you want and then click on "**RECONNECT**" on the top right blue button.

And you're good to go ðŸš€
