# How to update a data source?

When you edit a data source (e.g. add new columns to your data source), you will need to update the data source to have all your new fields available in Google Data Studio.

Let's take the following example: I'm working on my signups analysis and want to add some fields about the number of times people visited our landing page. My current data source does not have these fields:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (55).png>)

My exploration is already updated in [Whaly](https://whaly.io) but not in Google Data Studio

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (56).png>)

To update your fields in Google Data Studio, (you need to be in [Edit mode](https://docs.whaly.io/visualize/google-data-studio-1/google-data-studio-interface-explained)) start by editing the data source.&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (57).png>)

You can do that by clicking on a chart and click on the edit button

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (58).png>)

The following panel will open

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (59).png>)

You can click on "REFRESH FIELDS" at the bottom left side of the panel

Then click on "Apply"

Your fields are available in Google Data Studio !
