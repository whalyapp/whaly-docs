# Dimensions and metrics in Google Data Studio

In any data platform or visualization tool you will use, including Google Data Studio, data are displayed according two categories known as dimensions and metrics.&#x20;

Dimensions are the **labels** of your data and are **non numerical values.**

{% hint style="info" %}
The dimension represents the categories of your reports, it can generally be interpreted as the first column of your table
{% endhint %}

Metrics are the **measures** and are **numerical values** of your data (numbers, %, duration, currency).

{% hint style="info" %}
You can easily express a dimension and metric by filling the following sentence "I want to display my _metrics_ by _dimension"_

e.g. I want to display my revenue (measure -> metrics) per month (label -> dimension)\
I want to display my revenue (measure -> metrics) per month (label -> dimension)\
I want to display my revenue (measure -> metrics) per sales person (label -> dimension)\
I want to display my sites visits (measure -> metrics) per week per country (label -> dimension)
{% endhint %}

Another example here below, the "Query" column is the dimensions and the "Impressions, Clicks, Site, Average Position" are metrics
