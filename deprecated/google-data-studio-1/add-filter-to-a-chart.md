# Add filter to a chart

If you want to filter some very specific data about a chart in Google Data Studio, you can make it very easily.

First, make sure you're in "Edit" mode by clicking on the blue Edit button on the top right corner of the screen

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (109).png>)

Your interface should look like this, charts should be clickable.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (110).png>)

Select the chart you want to edit

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (112).png>)

On the right, under the Data source sub menu, scroll down to the "Filter" section

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (113).png>)

Click on "ADD A FILTER"

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (114).png>)

Click on "CREATE A FILTER"

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (115).png>)

Make sure you give it a clear name (e.g. what dimension your filtering or a clear description)

Pick Include or Exclude depending on what you want to filter.

Select an operator and field. Finally type the exact right value. Google Data Studio does not offer automatic fill, forcing you to know the exact value you want to filter.

Once you're done click on "SAVE".

Click on "ADD A FILTER" again in the filter sub-menu and select the filter you wish to apply.

You're done congrats! ðŸŽ‰
