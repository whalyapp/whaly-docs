# Connect Whaly to Google Data Studio

This guide will show you the first steps to visualise Whaly reports into Google Data Studio by adding and authorising the Whaly Google Data Studio connector.

&#x20;This will create what is called a **data source** that can be added to your Data Studio reports.

1\. Go to [datastudio.google.com](https://datastudio.google.com/) and log in with your Google account, if needed.

2\. In the top left corner, go to **Create â†’ Data source**.

* If you belong to multiple Whaly organisations, you'll be asked to select an organisation. Pick the organisation in which your report is published to continue.

If you do not find your Whaly report in the list, please make sure that you **Published** it in Whaly.
{% endhint %}

9\. You can also update the name of the data source file to something informative, for example based on the selected account(s).

* By default, the data source file will always be "Whaly", a good name would be the report name.

### **Your data source file has now been created!** ðŸŽ‰

You can directly start using the data source in a new report by clicking on **CREATE REPORT** in the top right corner of the field list.
