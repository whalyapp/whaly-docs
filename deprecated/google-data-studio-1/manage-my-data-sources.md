# Manage my data sources

Once you start working with Google Data Studio, you will start getting a couple of data sources. There are some tricks to manage your data sources

## Best practices to name explorations in Whaly and data sources in Google Data Studio

A very good practice to avoid getting lost between your explorations and Google Data Studio data sources is to give them name and name them the same between the two tools.

For instance in Whaly my exploration is named ‚è≥ Whaly Waitlist Contact Exploration

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (82).png>)

When I connect it to Google Data Studio I can rename it right away to make sure it will be consistent and easy to find because Google Data Studio will name it `Untitled Data Source` by default.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (83).png>)

You can rename it **BEFORE** clicking on CONNECT or do anything to be ensure finding back the data source linked to your exploration in Google Data Studio afterwards.

In your exploration click on its name

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (84).png>)

Select the title of the exploration and copy it

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (85).png>)

Paste it in the Google Data Studio connection request

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (86).png>)

Then click you can choose the date and click on CONNECT.

## What reports in Google Data Studio are used by what explorations from Whaly?

An easy way to check that is to go into the Resource menu and click on Manage added data sources

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (87).png>)

You can then see the number of charts used by each data source (and thus exploration)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (88).png>)

## How to find a newly created exploration in my data sources?

When you connect an exploration froml Whaly to Google Data Studio, it will automatically create a new data source.&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (91).png>)

Rename the newly created source

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (92).png>)

The new name will be `New exploration`

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (93).png>)

Click on CREATE REPORT

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (94).png>)

Google Data Studio automatically creates a new report called `Untitled Report` with your data source

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (95).png>)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (96).png>)

To use this data source in an existing report, go to the report you had

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (97).png>)

Click on `Ressource`, in the top menu and `Manage added data sources`

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (98).png>)

Select `+Add a data source` at the bottom of the screen

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (99).png>)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (100).png>)

Select `My data sources`

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (101).png>)

From this menu, you can add the newly created data source (in my case `New exploration`)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (102).png>)

Select it and click on Add at the bottom of the menu

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (104).png>)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (103).png>)

Congrats your data source is added üéâ

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (105).png>)

You can now have access to it from your existing report&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (106).png>)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (107).png>)
