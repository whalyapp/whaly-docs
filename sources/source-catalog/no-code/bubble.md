## Which Bubble data is synced by [Whaly](https://whaly.io)?

We will replicate all tables present in your Bubble base, so the schema will be dynamic based on your Bubble base schema.

We will create new tables for relationships and for select / multiselect fields.

## **Overview**

In order to connect your Bubble to Whaly, you will need the following:

1. The base URL of your Bubble API (Ex. `https://app.acme.com/api/1.1`)
2. Your Bubble API Token

Also, you'll need to activate the [Data API](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/api/data-api) in your Bubble project.
