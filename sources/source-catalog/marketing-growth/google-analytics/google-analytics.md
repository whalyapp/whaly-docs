## How to query Google Analytics data?

Whaly connector is syncing all Analytics Accounts, Properties & Apps and Views of the account selected in the authentication wizard.

In Google Analytics, Reports are attached to Views. When different Views are created on the same Properties & Apps, they're attached reports will contains duplicates.

Hence, when querying the synced reports, it's very important in order to get the proper values to always filter on the "Property/View" objects in order to avoid getting duplicates.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
The field `label` of the View object is recommended to be the field to filter on to get the same results as in Google Analytics.
