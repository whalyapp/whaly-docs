# MixPanel

## **Why syncing my MixPanel data to** [**Whaly**](https://whaly.io)**?**

Syncing your MixPanel can be useful for various use cases:

* Track your Users behaviours and your conversion ratios
* Communicate with your Customer Success team the product usage of each of your customer to detect upsells opportunities and churn risks
* Link your product usage data with your CRM and Revenue data to identify correlation and get insights into your offerings
* ...

## Connecting MixPanel data

Whaly recommend to use the native MixPanel connector to your Data Warehouse:

* [For BigQuery](https://developer.mixpanel.com/docs/mixpanel-bigquery-export-design)
* [For Snowflake](https://developer.mixpanel.com/docs/mixpanel-snowflake-export)

Once the data will be loading in your Data Warehouse, [you'll be able to import it into Whaly](broken-reference).
