# Segment

## **Why syncing my Segment data to** [**Whaly**](https://whaly.io)**?**

Syncing your Segment can be useful for various use cases:

* Track your Users behaviours and your conversion ratios
* Communicate with your Customer Success team the product usage of each of your customer to detect upsells opportunities and churn risks
* Link your product usage data with your CRM and Revenue data to identify correlation and get insights into your offerings
* ...

## Connecting Segment data

Whaly recommend to use the native Segment connector to your Data Warehouse:

* [For BigQuery](https://segment.com/docs/connections/storage/catalog/bigquery/)
* [For Snowflake](https://segment.com/docs/connections/storage/catalog/snowflake/)

Once the data will be loading in your Data Warehouse, [you'll be able to import it into Whaly](broken-reference).
