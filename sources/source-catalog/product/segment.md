# Segment

## **Why syncing my Segment data to** [**Whaly**](https://whaly.io)**?**

Syncing your Segment can be useful for various use cases:

* Track your Users behaviours and your conversion ratios
* Communicate with your Customer Success team the product usage of each of your customer to detect upsells opportunities and churn risks
* Link your product usage data with your CRM and Revenue data to identify correlation and get insights into your offerings
* ...

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Segment connector is only available for the customers using the Manager Warehouse deployment of Whaly.

For customers using [their own data warehouse](broken-reference), please directly [plug your segment instance to your own Warehouse](https://segment.com/docs/connections/storage/warehouses/) and then [import the resulting tables within Whaly.](../../../data-management/workbench/import-tables-from-your-data-warehouse.md)
