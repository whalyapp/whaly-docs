### Custom Objects

Whaly detects automatically your [Hubspot custom objects](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/crm-setup/use-custom-objects) and their association with other standards (contact, deal, ...) and custom objects in Hubspot.

The name of the generated table and list of fields depends on how you configured your custom objects schemas.



[You can find the relationship between all those objects here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/136dpFgcBg7L65z9\_NCJC5CemAWATkJwzn5q8U4SnNP8/edit?usp=sharing)

## Source considerations

1. Due a limitation of Hubspot API, it's impossible to detect Deals and Contacts that have been **deleted** since the last sync. Hence, the connector is running 1 `FULL TABLE` sync per day to make sure that deleted records in Hubspot are deleted in your Warehouse. The rest of the syncs are done using the `INCREMENTAL` replication method to save processing time.
2. **Merged contacts**: In order to identify Contacts that have been merged with another one, the connector is adding a field called `has_been_merged`.When set to `true`, it means that this contact has been merged with another one. To keep the same number as what you would find in Hubspot, you should exclude them for your reporting.
3. **Merged deals**: Merged Deals are deleted during the daily `FULL TABLE` sync.
4. **Custom Objects**: Because of a current limitation of the Custom Objects API, the connector is not able to run INCREMENTAL syncs at every run.
