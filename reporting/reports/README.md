# ðŸ“Š Dashboards

## What is a dashboard ?

A dashboard is a page containing multiple charts (charts can be a table, a bar chart, a funnel, a map, ...). Usually, a dashboard will contain multiple charts related to the same topic, or answering different parts of the same question.&#x20;

A dashboard can be shared internally with your team on Whaly, on externally with your customers or business partners, either:&#x20;

* In a passive way by using a sharing link
* In a proactive way by using pushes to share your report in Slack or via Email

You can make your dashboards interactive by adding filters on a dashboard. These filter will be available for the users and will filter data in the same way on all your configured tiles.&#x20;
