# 👨👩👧👦 What is a team?

A team is the group of all the users of your company. This is where you can see  who from your organization has created a Whaly account.

Inside your team, you can share multiple [Organization](broken-reference) to collaborate on Business Intelligence projects.

Member of a team can have 2 main roles:

* **Owner**: It means that you have access on the team management page, where you can review all Team Members, [Organizations](broken-reference) and configure the team security settings such as enabling Single Sign On
* **Regular member**: You are part of the team and can be invited into each Organization of the team is needed but you don't have any power on the team structure

### Managing the Team

For all **Team Owners**, a **Manage** button is available on the [Organization](broken-reference) selector screen ⤵️
