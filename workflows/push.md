# üöÄ Push

With **Push**, you can configure an [Action](actions/) on your **Dashboards** or **Questions**. Once configured, Push can be either triggered manually or scheduled to run periodically.

**Push** is a great way to send any reporting and data insights done inside Whaly to your colleagues, investors or stakeholders (partners, customers, etc.).&#x20;

Recipient of a **Push** doesn't need a direct access to the Whaly platform and it'll meet them where they are (Email, Slack, Google Sheets), hence it'll improve the adoption of any reporting done inside Whaly ü§ò

## ü™Ñ Creating/Listing Push

On Dashboards and Questions, you can click on the "**‚ö°Ô∏è Push**" button at the top right of the screen to list available **Push** and create new ones.
