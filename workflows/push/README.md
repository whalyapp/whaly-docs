# ðŸš€ Push

With **Push**, you can configure an [Action](../actions-catalog/) on your **Dashboards** or **Questions**. Once configured, Push can be either triggered manually or scheduled to run periodically.

**Push** is a great way to send any reporting and data insights done inside Whaly to your colleagues, investors or stakeholders (partners, customers, etc.).&#x20;

Recipient of a **Push** doesn't need a direct access to the Whaly platform and it'll meet them where they are (Email, Slack, Google Sheets), hence it'll improve the adoption of any reporting done inside Whaly ðŸ¤˜
