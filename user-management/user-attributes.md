# üè∑ User Attributes

User attributes allow for personalized experiences for Whaly users. These attributes are defined by Whaly administrators and can be applied to individual users.

User attributes can be referenced throughout Whaly to provide a custom experience for each user. Looker provides several default user attributes including:

* ID
* Email

#### Reports Filters

Filters on reports can be set to a user attribute to customize the query based on the user who is running it.

For example, you could configure a user attributes named "salesforce\_username" and customize it for every Whaly user by entering their Salesforce username as its value. By setting a filter on a dashboard using the "salesforce\_username" user attribute, each user would be able to view the dashboard with data filtered according to their particular Salesforce username.
