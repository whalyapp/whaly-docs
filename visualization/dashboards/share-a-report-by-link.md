# 🔗 Share a report by link

Whaly offers 2 ways of sharing a report:

1. Sharing Link
2. Public Link (deprecated)

## Sharing Link

A Sharing Link is a link that can be accessed by anyone even without having a Whaly account. It's perfect for partners, investors, teammates (Sales rep, ...), TV in your offices, etc.

A Sharing Link can:

* 🔐 Be password protected to make sure your data is secured
* 🔎 Contains a set of pre-defined filters to restrict access

A single report can have multiple Sharing Link with different passwords and pre-defined filters for each audience. This way you can share a single dashboard to hundred of different stakeholders.

To create a Sharing Link, click on "share" on the top right corner of a Report.

On the panel that open, you can view all the already existing Sharing Links, edit them or get their link.

At the bottom of the panel, you can click on "**New Sharing Link**" to create a new sharing link.

## Public Link (⚠️ deprecated)

A Public Link is generating an URL that gives access to the report to all people loading it. A Report can only have a single Public Link.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Public Link were deprecated in February 2022.&#x20;

You should use a Sharing Link instead as Sharing Link gives you more flexibility and security (filters, password, multiple).

Existing Public Link will continue to work but it'll soon be impossible to generate new ones.
